Computers can now generate text, translate automatically from one language to another, analyze comments, label words in sentences, and much more.\n\nPerhaps the most widely practically useful application of NLP is *classification* -- that is, classifying a document automatically into some category. This can be used, for instance, for:\n\n- Sentiment analysis (e.g are people saying *positive* or *negative* things about your product)\n- Author identification (what author most likely wrote some document)\n- Legal discovery (which documents are in scope for a trial)\n- Organizing documents by topic\n- Triaging inbound emails\n- ...and much more!\n\nClassification models can also be used to solve problems that are not, at first, obviously appropriate. For instance, consider the Kaggle [U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/) competition. In this, we are tasked with comparing two words or short phrases, and scoring them based on whether they're similar or not, based on which patent class they were used in. With a score of `1` it is considered that the two inputs have identical meaning, and `0` means they have totally different meaning. For instance, *abatement* and *eliminating process* have a score of `0.5`, meaning they're somewhat similar, but not identical.\n\nIt turns out that this can be represented as a classification problem. How? By representing the question like this:\n\n> For the following text...: \"TEXT1: abatement; TEXT2: eliminating process\" ...chose a category of meaning similarity: \"Different; Similar; Identical\".\n\nIn this notebook we'll see how to solve the Patent Phrase Matching problem by treating it as a classification task, by representing it in a very similar way to that shown above.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### On Kaggle","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Kaggle is an awesome resource for aspiring data scientists or anyone looking to improve their machine learning skills. There is nothing like being able to get hands-on practice and receiving real-time feedback to help you improve your skills. It provides:\n\n1. Interesting data sets\n1. Feedback on how you're doing\n1. A leader board to see what's good, what's possible, and what's state-of-art\n1. Notebooks and blog posts by winning contestants share useful tips and techniques.\n\nThe dataset we will be using here is only available from Kaggle. Therefore, you will need to register on the site, then go to the [page for the competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching). On that page click \"Rules,\" then \"I Understand and Accept.\" (Although the competition has finished, and you will not be entering it, you still have to agree to the rules to be allowed to download the data.)\n\nThere are two ways to then use this data:\n\n- Easiest: run this notebook directly on Kaggle, or\n- Most flexible: download the data locally and run it on your PC or GPU server\n\nIf you are running this on Kaggle.com, you can skip the next section. Just make sure that on Kaggle you've selected to use a GPU during your session, by clicking on the hamburger menu (3 dots in the top right) and clicking \"Accelerator\" -- it should look like this:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -Uqq fastai fastbook\n!pip install -Uqq dataset\n    \nfrom fastcore.all import *\nfrom fastbook import search_images_ddg","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-16T01:36:14.720577Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-16T01:36:14.720899Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-16T01:36:49.874548Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-16T01:36:14.720865Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-16T01:36:49.873434Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -Uqq pyarrow==8.0.0\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pyarrow","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now you can download datasets from Kaggle.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import and EDA","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"path = Path('../input/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-16T01:38:40.968067Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-16T01:38:40.968398Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-16T01:38:40.973803Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-16T01:38:40.968362Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-16T01:38:40.972843Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It looks like this competition uses CSV files.

Given enough time and experiments, you'll find lots of these coincidental improvements. That means you're actually over-fitting to your validation set!\n\nThat's why we keep a test set held back.

But don't check too often, or you'll be even over-fitting to the test set!\n\nKaggle has a *second* test set, which is yet another held-out dataset that's only used at the *end* of the competition to assess your predictions. That's called the \"private leaderboard\". Here's a [great post](https://gregpark.io/blog/Kaggle-Psychopathy-Postmortem/) about what can happen if you overfit to the public leaderboard.\n\nWe'll use `eval` as our name for the test set, to avoid confusion with the `test` dataset that was created above.","metadata":{"hidden":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"eval_df['input'] = 'TEXT1: ' + eval_df.context + '; TEXT2: ' + eval_df.target + '; ANC1: ' + eval_df.anchor\neval_ds = Dataset.from_pandas(eval_df).map(tok_func, batched=True)","metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Metrics and correlation","metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When we're training a model, there will be one or more *metrics* that we're interested in maximising or minimising. These are the measurements that should, hopefully, represent how well our model will works for us.\n\nIn real life, outside of Kaggle, things not easy... As my partner Dr Rachel Thomas notes in [The problem with metrics is a big problem for AI](https://www.fast.ai/2019/09/24/metrics/):\n\n>  At their heart, what most current AI approaches do is to optimize metrics. The practice of optimizing metrics is not new nor unique to AI, yet AI can be particularly efficient (even too efficient!) at doing so. This is important to understand, because any risks of optimizing metrics are heightened by AI. While metrics can be useful in their proper place, there are harms when they are unthinkingly applied. Some of the scariest instances of algorithms run amok all result from over-emphasizing metrics. We have to understand this dynamic in order to understand the urgent risks we are facing due to misuse of AI.\n\nIn Kaggle, however, it's very straightforward to know what metric to use: Kaggle will tell you! According to this competition's [evaluation page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/overview/evaluation), \"*submissions are evaluated on the [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) between the predicted and actual similarity scores*.\" This coefficient is usually abbreviated using the single letter *r*. It is the most widely used measure of the degree of relationship between two variables.\n\nr can vary between `-1`, which means perfect inverse correlation, and `+1`, which means perfect positive correlation. The mathematical formula for it is much less important than getting a good intuition for what the different values look like. To start to get that intuition, let's look at some examples using the [California Housing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset) dataset, which shows \"*is the median house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars*\". This dataset is provided by the excellent [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library, which is the most widely used library for machine learning outside of deep learning.","metadata":{"hidden":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\nhousing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)\nhousing = housing['data'].join(housing['target']).sample(1000, random_state=52)\nhousing.head()","metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see all the correlation coefficients for every combination of columns in this dataset by calling `np.corrcoef`:","metadata":{"hidden":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"np.set_printoptions(precision=2, suppress=True)\n\nnp.corrcoef(housing, rowvar=False)","metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This works well when we're getting a bunch of values at once, but it's overkill when we want a single coefficient:","metadata":{"hidden":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"np.corrcoef(housing.MedInc, housing.MedHouseVal)","metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Therefore, we'll create this little function to just return the single number we need given a pair of variables:","metadata":{"hidden":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def corr(x,y): return np.corrcoef(x,y)[0][1]\n\ncorr(housing.MedInc, housing.MedHouseVal)","metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we'll look at a few examples of correlations, using this function (the details of the function don't matter too much):","metadata":{"hidden":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def show_corr(df, a, b):\n    x,y = df[a],df[b]\n    plt.scatter(x,y, alpha=0.5, s=4)\n    plt.title(f'{a} vs {b}; r: {corr(x, y):.2f}')","metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"OK, let's check out the correlation between income and house value:","metadata":{"hidden":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"show_corr(housing, 'MedInc', 'MedHouseVal')","metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So that's what a correlation of 0.68 looks like.

If there's outliers in your data, then the relationship between them will dominate the metric.
