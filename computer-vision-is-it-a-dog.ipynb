Practical Deep Learning is a free course designed for people who have some coding experience and want to learn how to apply deep learning and maching learning to practical problems.  \n\nI have found an understanding of how to program in Python is a requirement to complete this course along with a good understanding of the mathematical concepts.  I have spent some time refershing my memory of the NumPy package using the book [NumPy for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/numpy-basics) by Wes McKinney.  The NumPy pachage is used in the course to load and clean data along with building the models.  I have also found the need to refresh my memory of some of mathmatical concepts included in deep learning including gradient descent.  I really recommend the videos produced by [StatQuest](https://statquest.org/) on [gradient descent](https://youtu.be/sDv4f4s2SB8?si=SZjknb9ca-nl18ie) and others related to statistics and machine learning.  Josh Starmer created StatQuest to attempt to explain statistics to his former co-wokers.  His vidoes are simple easy to understand, and engaging! \n\nThis Juypter notebook is a copy of Jeremy Howard's notebook called [Is it a bird? Creating a model from your own data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data).  I modified Jeremy's notebook to determine if an image is a dog or a cat.  I have two portugese water dogs and 1 three legged cat, so I thought it would be fun to focus on them.  The objective of the notebook is to create and train a model to determine if an image is a dog or cat.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# It's a good idea to ensure you're running the latest version of any libraries you need.\n# `!pip install -Uqq <libraries>` upgrades to the latest version of <libraries>\n# You can safely ignore any warnings or errors pip spits out about running as root or incompatibilities\nimport os\n\niskaggle = os.environ.get('KAGGLE_KERNEL_RUN_TYPE', '')\nif iskaggle:\n    !pip install -Uqq fastai fastbook","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-31T13:46:34.658765Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-31T13:46:34.659096Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-31T13:46:55.929652Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-31T13:46:34.659001Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-31T13:46:55.92893Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The basic steps we'll take are:\n\n1.
